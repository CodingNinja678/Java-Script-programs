O/P:
Array=["hi","hello","hola",["thanks","thank you"]]


pop()//remove  item
var Array1=["hi","hello","hola"]
var Array2=Array.pop()
O/P:Array2="hola"

shift()//removes final element
var Array1=["hi","hello","hola"]
var Array2=Array.shift()
O/P:Array2="hola"
var Array2=["hello","hola"]

unshift()//opposite of shift
